# A/B Testing: US Open Men's vs Women's Final Viewership

## Project Overview

This project applies **A/B testing** to compare the viewership of the **US Open Men’s Finals** (Group A) and the **US Open Women’s Finals** (Group B). The goal is to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average viewership between the two finals using real-world data.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Test if there is a significant difference in the viewership of the men's and women's finals.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two groups.
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate 95% confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty around the mean viewership estimates.
4. **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the viewership data to better understand the results.
